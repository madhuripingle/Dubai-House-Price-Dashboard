# Dubai-House-Price-Dashboard

This project showcases an interactive Tableau dashboard built to analyze housing price trends based on various property features. Using a dataset of 50,000+ housing listings, the dashboard uncovers how location, size, and amenities affect home prices â€” helping buyers, sellers, and investors make data-driven decisions.
